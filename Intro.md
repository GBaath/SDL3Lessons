## Wth Is SDL3?

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a library made to provide access to hardware components.
For our purposes, a tool to skip the boring parts of making a game engine.

- Open source, in C
- Native support for C++
- Other languages we don't care about for now

*Features include but not limited too*:
- Graphics Rendering
- Audio Playback
- Input Handling
- Multithreading & Timers
- Netwworking (We'll skip this, but its here)
- Extentions/Plugins
- Headaches
- Making you a pro coder

## Changes from SDL2

A bunch of architectural changes, header restructuring, and other things we don't need to think about.

#### The key takeaway:

Double check wether the youtube tutorial is made for the new version before wasting 3 hours of your life debugging and getting shamed in the video comments

## SDL3 vs. Game Engines

This is like comparing a car to a warehouse of parts.
Cringe game engine user vs chad game engine developer.

#### You get to:
- Rarely blame anyone but yourself for your bugs
- Feel really good about yourself when you make progress
- Learn to downscope harder than ever before
- Sit at the grown up table
- [Avoid getting bullied by notch](https://x.com/notch/status/1879635187572838836?lang=en)

### Actual points to consider:
- Skip hidden black box logic
- Decide the game loops yourself
- Preformant af
- Knowing how a game engine works obviously makes you better at using one (skilldif)

## Cool things you'll learn

- C++ syntax
- Manual resource management  
- Rendering and audio pipelines
