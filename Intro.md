## Wth Is SDL3?

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a library made to provide access to hardware components.
For our purposes, a tool to skip the boring parts of making a game engine.

- Open source, in C
- Native support for C++
- Other languages we don't care about for now

*Features include but not limited too*:
- Graphics Rendering
- Audio Playback
- Input Handling
- Multithreading & Timers
- Netwworking (We'll skip this, but its here)
- Extentions/Plugins
- Headaches
- Making you a pro coder

## SDL3 vs. Game Engines

How SDL3 compares with full-fledged engines like **Unity** or **Unreal**, and when to choose each.

- Level of abstraction  
- Control and flexibility  
- Performance considerations  
- Learning curve

## Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions to get SDL3 up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)  
- CMake or your build system of choice  
- Git  

### Installing SDL3

1. Clone the SDL3 repository  
2. Configure with CMake (or your build tool)  
3. Build and install  

### Verifying Your Installation

- Compile and run the “hello window” example  
- Check library versions and include paths
