## Collision Detection

### Bounding boxes

The most basic form of collision detection is comparing two hitboxes against eachother.
A "separating angles test" between two axis aligned bounding boxes (AABB).
In caveman terms: look at squares. one square overlap other squar. no ):< 

We'll add an intersection test to our example cube and check.

<details>
<summary>Examplecube.h</summary>

 ```cpp

class ExampleCube : public GameObject {
public:
	ExampleCube(SDL_Renderer* renderer, int x, int y, int w, int h, SDL_Texture* texture) : GameObject(renderer, x, y, w, h, texture) {	};
	~ExampleCube() {};


	virtual void Update(float DeltaTime, float ScaledDeltaTime) override;
	virtual void Render() override;

	bool Intersects(const SDL_FRect& other) const {

		bool noOverlap =
			rect.x + rect.w <= other.x ||  //left of other
			other.x + other.w <= rect.x || //right of other
			rect.y + rect.h <= other.y ||  //above other
			other.y + other.h <= rect.y;   //is below other

		return !noOverlap;
	}

```
</details>

We can now check an input rect against it and determine if the overlap.
Notice the const keywords, theese show the compilera that we will *not* be modifying the statement following it.
Since we're working with pointers and references this is a form of extra safety and is good for readability.

### Resolving Collisions

Where do we use this new and fancy intersection check? Depending on how overkill you want to make your collision system, the answer can vary from "three inheritance layers deep in an intricate, layered physics manager" to "no".
For this example we'll settle by shoving it directly into our player class.
Nothing wrong with this, but if you're used to game engines, this feels kinda yucky.

<details>
<summary>Player.cpp</summary>

 ```cpp
void Player::Update(float DeltaTime, float ScaledDeltaTime)
{
    GameObject::Update(DeltaTime, ScaledDeltaTime);

    float speed = 7.f;

    if (InputManager::IsKeyDown(SDL_SCANCODE_W))
        Move(0, -speed, *ExampleObstacle);
    if (InputManager::IsKeyDown(SDL_SCANCODE_S)) 
        Move(0, speed, *ExampleObstacle);
    if (InputManager::IsKeyDown(SDL_SCANCODE_A)) 
        Move(-speed, 0, *ExampleObstacle);
    if (InputManager::IsKeyDown(SDL_SCANCODE_D)) 
        Move(speed, 0, *ExampleObstacle);
        

}

void Player::Move(float dX, float dY, const ExampleCube& exCube)
{
    //moving in X
    rect.x += dX;
    if (exCube.Intersects(rect)) {
        if (dX > 0) { //moving right
            rect.x = exCube.rect.x - rect.w;
        }
        else if (dX < 0) { //moving left
            rect.x = exCube.rect.x + exCube.rect.w;
        }
    }
    //moving in Y
    rect.y += dY;
    if (exCube.Intersects(rect)) {
        if (dY > 0) { //moving down
            rect.y = exCube.rect.y - rect.h;
        }
        else if (dY < 0) { //moving up
            rect.y = exCube.rect.y + exCube.rect.h;
        }
    }
}



```

What we're doing here is after shifting our react with the movement input,
check against our referenced example obstacle, and if overlapping, shove our rect back to where it came from.
