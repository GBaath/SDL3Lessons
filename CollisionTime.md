# Lesson 3 â€“ Collision, Application Time, Timers & Framerate

---

## Intro

---

## Key Concepts

- Collision shapes & responses
- Delta time handling
- Scheduled callbacks
- Frame pacing strategies

---

## Collision Detection

- Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB)
- Circle vs Rectangle
- Spatial partitioning techniques

---

## Application Time

- Calculating delta time
- Time scaling and slow motion
- Pause and resume mechanics

---

## Timers

- One-shot timers
- Repeating timers
- Integrating callbacks into game loop

---

## Framerate Management

- Fixed timestep loop
- Frame rate capping
- VSync configuration

---
