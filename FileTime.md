# Lesson 3 â€“ File Splitting, Application Time, Timers & Framerate

---

## Intro

---

## Key Concepts

- Modular codebase structure
- Delta time handling
- Scheduled callbacks

---

## File Splitting

- Header vs source separation
- Module organization
- Include guards vs #pragma once

---

## Class Inheritance

- Base and derived classes
- Virtual functions & overrides
- Abstract classes & interfaces

---

## Application Time

- Calculating delta time
- Time scaling and slow motion
- Pause and resume mechanics

---

## Timers

- One-shot timers
- Repeating timers
- Integrating callbacks into game loop

---

## Framerate Management

- Fixed timestep loop
- Frame rate capping
- VSync configuration

---
