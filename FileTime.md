# Lesson 3 â€“ File Splitting, Application Time, Timers & Framerate

---

## Intro

---

## Concepts

- C++ Files & Inheritance
- Keeping it modular
- Framerate

---

## Files

- Headers & Source
- Include paths
- Include guards vs #pragma once

---

## Class Inheritance

- Base and derived classes
- Virtuals & overrides
- Smart pointers

---

## Application Time

- Locking framrate
- Time scaling and slow motion
- Pause and resume mechanics

---

## Timers

- One-shot timers
- Repeating timers
- Integrating callbacks into game loop

---

## Code Example
