# Why do these lessons exist?

There has historically been a demand for C++ in the Game Creator Program and I figured the easiest and fastest way to make it a reality was to supply it myself.

Working lower-level *WILL* make you a better coder and I hope the comming weeks will open your eyes to the more frustating and appealing parts of game development.

All feedback is always welcome and encouraged, but I'll never ever reduce the amount millenial-coder-depression-shitposts.

# What will you learn?

I've tried tot set up these lessons as a sort of guide on what to do, and in what order, since I fondly belive that failing over and over again is the best way to level up your coding skills.

Stripping away the editor layer of game development will force you to gain insight on how game engines work, and hopefully peel back the shroud over all the native game engine classes *juuust* a lil' bit.

Building intuition is more important that providing a cheat-sheet, and it's that intuition that will considerably lower your time debugging.

Remember, it's fine to not understand everything. Struggleing is literally the point.

tl;dr: work lower level, grow your brain 🦍

Let's go farm for build/compiler/syntax errors!
